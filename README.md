# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my repository for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2024! Here you'll find my solutions to the daily programming puzzles.

## 📝 About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that begins on December 1st and ends on December 25th. Each day consists of two puzzles that unlock at midnight EST.

## 🚀 My Progress

| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 | Solution |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Solution](Day-1/day1.go) |
| [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2) | ⭐ | ⭐ | [Solution](Day-2/day2.go) |
<!-- Add more days as you complete them -->

## 💻 Structure

Each day's solution is in its own directory with the following structure:
```
Day-XX/
  ├── data.txt
  ├── dayX.go
  └── go.mod
```

## 🛠️ Running the Solutions

To run any day's solution:

```bash
cd Day-XX
go run .
```

## 🌟 Goals for 2024

- [ ] Complete all 25 days
- [ ] Optimize solutions for performance
- [ ] Write clear, documented code
- [ ] Learn something new each day

## 📝 Notes

- All solutions are written in Go
- Each day includes both the solution and the input data
- Comments and documentation are included for readability

## 🤝 Contact
